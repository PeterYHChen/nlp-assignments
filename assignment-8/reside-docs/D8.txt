Anyone want to take a screenshot?  <quote> Mr. Dylan Avery of San Diego, California and Mr. Korey Rowe, of Oneonta, New York (under the guidance Mr. Patrick Kwiatkowski and Mr. Joel Bachar of Microcinema International) have an outstanding debt, which they refuse to pay, with The Frankfurt Group in Fort Worth, Texas - until this debt is paid, this page will remain - we apologize for the inconvenience and do hope that these in-house disputes are resolved promptly  As an aside, Mr. Dylan Avery and Mr. Korey Rowe had a genuine opportunity to obtain a "founder's donation" in excess of $200,000 but instead decided their personal vendetta was far more important than assisting the dying first-responders of 9/11.  </TEXT>
