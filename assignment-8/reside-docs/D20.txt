To:  *The Texas Girl* Muhammad Al-Ohaideb â€¢ Al-Riyadh  After so much was written in the American media regarding the Qatif girl who was sentenced by a Saudi court to 200 lashes and six months in prison, the case of a Texas woman, who was gang-raped by her American coworkers in Baghdad, was covered up by the company she worked for and also by the US government.  Jamie Leigh Jones, now 22, said that several men at a camp in the Green Zone in Baghdad raped her and that her company, Halliburton, then put her under guard in a shipping container with a bed and warned her that if she left Iraq for medical treatment, she would lose her job.  </TEXT>
